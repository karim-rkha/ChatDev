This is the basic structure of the Tic Tac Toe game application. The main file `main.py` contains the GUI implementation using tkinter. It creates a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the Tic Tac Toe board. The `make_move` function is called when a button is clicked, and it updates the game state accordingly. The `show_result` function displays the game result in a message box when the game is over.

The game logic is implemented in the `Game` class in `game.py`. It keeps track of the game board and the current player. The `make_move` function updates the board and switches the current player. The `is_game_over` function checks if the game is over by checking for a win or a draw. The `get_result` function returns the result of the game (X wins, O wins, draw, or empty if the game is not over yet).

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` file. The GUI window will open, and you can start playing Tic Tac Toe.

This is the basic structure of the Tic Tac Toe game application. The main file `main.py` contains the GUI implementation using tkinter. It creates a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the Tic Tac Toe board. The `make_move` function is called when a button is clicked, and it updates the game state accordingly. The `show_result` function displays the game result in a message box when the game is over.

The game logic is implemented in the `Game` class in `game.py`. It keeps track of the game board and the current player. The `make_move` function updates the board and switches the current player. The `is_game_over` function checks if the game is over by checking for a win or a draw. The `get_result` function returns the result of the game (X wins, O wins, draw, or empty if the game is not over yet).

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` file. The GUI window will open, and you can start playing Tic Tac Toe.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is that the `tkinter.messagebox` module is not imported in the `main.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to display the game result using `tk.messagebox.showinfo()`.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:
```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

This will import the `messagebox` module from the `tkinter` package, allowing the game result to be displayed correctly.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready to run without any errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `tkinter.messagebox` module is not imported in the `main.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to display the game result using `tk.messagebox.showinfo()`.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:
```python
from tkinter import messagebox
```

This will import the `messagebox` module from the `tkinter` package, allowing the game result to be displayed correctly.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready to run without any errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[2023-26-10 17:42:55 INFO] Code Reviewer: <COMMENT>
The code is well-structured and follows the regulations mentioned. However, there is one potential bug in the `get_result` method of the `Game` class. The method returns "draw" instead of "It's a draw!" when the game ends in a draw. To fix this, you should update the return statement in the `get_result` method to return "It's a draw!" instead of "draw".

<REVISION>
In the `get_result` method of the `Game` class, update the return statement as follows:

```python
return "It's a draw!"
```

This will ensure that the correct message is displayed when the game ends in a draw.

Once you make this revision, the code will be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is well-structured and follows the regulations mentioned. However, there is one potential bug in the `get_result` method of the `Game` class. The method returns "draw" instead of "It's a draw!" when the game ends in a draw. To fix this, you should update the return statement in the `get_result` method to return "It's a draw!" instead of "draw".

<REVISION>
In the `get_result` method of the `Game` class, update the return statement as follows:

```python
return "It's a draw!"
```

This will ensure that the correct message is displayed when the game ends in a draw.

Once you make this revision, the code will be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[2023-26-10 17:44:51 INFO] Code Reviewer: <Comment>
The code is well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one comment with the highest priority:

In the `TicTacToeApp` class, the `make_move` method should check if the button has already been clicked before allowing the player to make a move. Currently, the code allows the player to overwrite an already clicked button.

To fix this, you can add a check in the `make_move` method to see if the button text is empty before making a move. If the button text is not empty, the method should return without making any changes.

Here's the revised code for the `make_move` method:

```python
def make_move(self, row, col):
    if self.game.is_game_over():
        return
    if self.buttons[row][col].cget("text") != "":
        return
    if self.game.make_move(row, col):
        self.buttons[row][col].config(text=self.game.get_current_player())
        if self.game.is_game_over():
            self.show_result()
```

This change ensures that the player cannot overwrite an already clicked button.

Please make this modification and test the application to ensure that the fix works as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one comment with the highest priority:

In the `TicTacToeApp` class, the `make_move` method should check if the button has already been clicked before allowing the player to make a move. Currently, the code allows the player to overwrite an already clicked button.

To fix this, you can add a check in the `make_move` method to see if the button text is empty before making a move. If the button text is not empty, the method should return without making any changes.

Here's the revised code for the `make_move` method:

```python
def make_move(self, row, col):
    if self.game.is_game_over():
        return
    if self.buttons[row][col].cget("text") != "":
        return
    if self.game.make_move(row, col):
        self.buttons[row][col].config(text=self.game.get_current_player())
        if self.game.is_game_over():
            self.show_result()
```

This change ensures that the player cannot overwrite an already clicked button.

Please make this modification and test the application to ensure that the fix works as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

requirements.txt

```
tkinter==8.6
```

This file specifies that the project requires the tkinter package with version 8.6. The tkinter package is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the Tic Tac Toe game application.

Please note that tkinter is a standard Python library, so it should already be available in most Python installations. However, specifying it in the requirements.txt file ensures that the correct version is used and helps in managing the project's dependencies.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Tic Tac Toe game project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
```
This file specifies that the project requires the tkinter package with version 8.6. The tkinter package is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the Tic Tac Toe game application.
Please note that tkinter is a standard Python library, so it should already be available in most Python installations. However, specifying it in the requirements.txt file ensures that the correct version is used and helps in managing the project's dependencies. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
